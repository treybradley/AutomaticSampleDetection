# AutomaticSampleDetection

For my thesis project, i designed music information retrieval (MIR) experiments in automatic sample detection. Sampling refers to the embedding of previously recorded audio into a new song. Hip-Hop and Electronic music are widely known for this composition and production technique. This research was motivated by learning about networks of musical influence between artists and genres that are created with sampling. I wanted to approach the topic in an automatic and data-based way that would rid sample detection of human error and inefficiency.

The scripts in this repository are the main scripts that ran and evaluated the systems and experiments. I included the notebook's outputs in ffnmfDtwPlots.ipynb to illustrate the different steps along the source separation aproach to automatic sample detection, as described in my thesis document.

Please contact me if you would like the thesis document (.pdf) or the audio data and annotations (.csv) that were used in this project.
